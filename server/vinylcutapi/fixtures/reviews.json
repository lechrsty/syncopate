            "artist": "24 Carat Black",
            "description": "Embraced in the early 90s by Britain's rare groove scene and later sampled by Digable Planets and Jay-Z, Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth has since been known as 24-Carat Black's first and final chapter, barely a footnote in the well documented history of Stax. For 35 years, the sketches for 24-Carat Black's sophomore release hibernated in keyboardist and session engineer Bruce Thompson's basement below the south side of Chicago. Abandoned by arranger Dale Warren when the studio bill darkened his mailbox, the tapes, over decades, had fallen into soggy disrepair, useless save for the six tracks featured on our release. Gone: The Promises Of Yesterday is by no means a sequel to Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth—missing are the poignant and bleak sermons on the pain of inner-city existence, replaced by dusky, sensuous re-workings of tainted love songs Warren had written as far back as 1965, during his time as a songwriter at Shrine and Motown. Still, his unfinished self-reinvention, even heard through the prism of these skeletal remnants, delivers on a remarkable purity of vision: one man's corner of black culture, 24 carats pure and mishandled perhaps until now, finally a bit less misunderstood. Rediscovered in the early 90s by Britain's rare groove scene, Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth has since been known as 24-Carat Black's first and final chapter, barely a footnote in the well documented history of Stax. Dale Warren's brainchild band simply pushed past their concept's conclusion, piling up dozens of reels for an intimate follow-up album that no one in the world wanted to hear. With their ambitious LP downgraded to cutout status when Stax finally shuttered in 1975, 24-Carat Black found themselves watching their moment recede in the rearview. Of more than 20 songs he considered for the 24-Carat Black follow-up, we've refurbished the six that hadn't flaked off their reels: dusky, sensuous reworkings of love songs Warren had written as far back as 1965. Wildly divergent in tone, scope and mission, the second 24-Carat Black album is tethered to the first by a single, crucial element: its creator.",

            "title": "UK Grim",
            "artist": "Sleaford Mods",
            "description": "Sleaford Mods don't make music about how terrible things are in hopes that they will get better. Over the past decade, Andrew Fearn and Jason Williamson have channeled public discontent and everyday malaise in the UK, scrutinizing their country's faults as well as their own. And though they've found personal growth and commercial success, the Mods' outlook hasn't brightened. On their new album, UK GRIM, things are bad and only getting worse. Government is incompetent; hypocrisy is alive and well in the upper ranks of society; consumerist conformity is a plague and music can't save you. All this probably sounds like your recent doom scroll, but UK GRIM is balanced by the mutating electro-punk of Fearn's production and the absurdist humor with which Williamson seeds his diatribes. Fearn has always thought less is more. “I think people try too hard and there's too much turd polishing,” he once stated of the competition. His approach is uniquely austere—a steady kick drum paired with chirping birds or clanking iron, plus a prowling bass. On UK GRIM, a simple formula (“Get a really crap drum beat and play a bassline over it”) still leads to unexpected places. If the lyrics offer no sense of consolatory hope, there's still the chameleonic vibrancy of the music, and the strongest tracks contain a shifting guitar flourish that feels like connective tissue between the boldface beats and cantankerous vocals. In “On the Ground,” Fearn transforms the zaps of retro Atari games into rubbery, panicked synth-punk. The album's most bizarre highlight, “So Trendy,” casts Perry Farrell in the role of a selfie-obsessed gym bro who ponders getting a “mushroom haircut and a cross earring.” Synthetic bleeps and blurgs pop up like a Whac-A-Mole, balanced by an ascending distorted guitar melody that morphs into fevered surf rock.In Williamson's quasi-spoken social commentary, no one comes out clean: You're either full of shit or busy dealing with someone else's. “I got crisis stamina,” he spews on the title track. “Full marathon, four poo breaks.” Further still: “I can feel the shit from your crisis rays/Spray out my back.” Ridiculous reality calls for ridiculous rhetoric, and UK GRIM is an overflowing toilet. But Williamson balances the biting takedowns—of Britain's conservative party on “Tory Kong” and try-hard punk wannabes on “D.I.Why”—with referential character vignettes and chaotic scenes that turn self-reflective. “Right Wing Beast” begins by attacking ignorant partisanship but lands on a revealing monologue about the psychic toll that opposing values can take on a relationship. “I thought about deleting you on socials,” he admits, breaking his sing-song tone. “Because you keep coming in with stuff and it's winding me up to be honest. I never see ya. I don't want to either.” ",

            "title": "Instant Vintage",
            "artist": "Raphael Saadiq",
            "description": "When it came time to promote Erykah Badu's 1997 album Baduizm, William 'Kedar' Massenburg started looking for the right name to describe the sound. It needed to be short, snazzy, something to capture how artists like Badu and D'Angelo—both of whom Massenburg was managing—incorporated modern hip-hop and electronic styles into their music. He landed on 'neo-soul,' and it stuck.Neo-soul caught on quickly in no small part because it was a marketing term. The name was useful shorthand for fans and critics, but many of the artists who fell under the neo-soul umbrella didn't appreciate it. 'There's nothing 'neo' about it. It's just soul,' Raphael Saadiq said of the label during an interview about his 2002 solo debut Instant Vintage. A son of soul who, by this time, had produced and played sessions for both D'Angelo and Badu, Saadiq saw the label as limiting, an unnecessary divide between the innovation of the present and the foundation of the past: 'Otis Redding would turn over in his grave right now if he heard someone say 'neo-soul.'' Saadiq floated his own term: gospeldelic. 'Gospel is for the truth in the sound and the words,' he continued. '-Delic represents the funky part and the room to experiment.' Gospeldelic never caught on in the same way (or at all), but Saadiq committed to it anyway. Sampled voices saying the phrase are scratched into Instant Vintage's triumphant opening track 'Doing What I Can,' all shuffling bass riffs, swirling strings, and crisp drum programming. And he stands by it on the second half of the album's closing track 'Skyy, Can You Feel Me,' saying 'it came from God' over a bed of wah-wah pedal and warbling synths. Functionally, gospeldelic pulls from the same tradition as neo-soul—they're both preoccupied with the intersection of soul, hip-hop, rock, funk, blues, and electronic music. But where some artists in the neo-soul movement strove to blur the lines between old and new, Saadiq honored the old school. Instant Vintage wasn't a vehicle for spirituality or a way to reap the benefits of a newly popular subgenre. He saw it as his duty to not just revolutionize what audiences considered to be soul music, but to breathe new life into tradition, to carry on a legacy. Saadiq's vision had its share of arrogance, backed up by a career that had already spanned two decades. Born Charles Ray Wiggins in 1966, he was the only one of 14 siblings to be born in Oakland, California. Music came early: He first took interest at age 6, teaching himself to play guitar, drums, and—his favorite—bass. By middle school, he was singing in gospel groups and spending summers at the Young Musicians Program at Berklee, where he was already approaching the level of a professional session musician. Days before his 18th birthday, he stumbled into the opportunity of a lifetime. He was at a studio in Oakland when he got a call that drummer Sheila E. was seeking touring musicians to join the Revolution on Prince's upcoming Parade tour. Auditions were the next day. Other hopefuls showed up in flamboyant Prince gear but Wiggins, dressed down in jeans and a baseball cap, made quick work of his audition. When Sheila's people asked for his name, he responded with the first one that came to mind: Raphael.",
